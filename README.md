# MONEY MINDER: YOUR PERSONAL BUDGET GUIDE

The motivation behind the Money Minder website stems from the increasing need for individuals to manage their finances effectively in today's dynamic world. With the proliferation of online transactions and varying expense patterns, there arises a necessity for a comprehensive tool that can simplify expense tracking and financial management.
The goal is to empower users with a user-friendly platform that provides insights into their spending habits, aids in budgeting, and promotes financial awareness and discipline.

Technologies used for development:
1. HTML for structure
2. CSS for styling
3. JavaScript for interactivity and client-side validation

The header contains the logo, navigation bar with the links to features tab, contact tab, about tab, and login/register link. The main working page appears after successful user login which contains dashboard.

Further enhancements are yet to be done, like linking a database for storing user information and analysing spending habits by data visualization.

The HTML,CSS and JS files are uploaded for the same along with the background photo jpg files and json files .
